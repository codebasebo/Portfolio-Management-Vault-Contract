# **Crypto Vault Management Contract**

**CryptoVault** is a decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contract designed to help users securely manage and optimize their crypto assets, such as ETH, WETH, and DAI. With integrations like **Chainlink** for price feeds and **Uniswap V3** for decentralized trading, this contract provides advanced features like automatic portfolio rebalancing, ETH/WETH wrapping, and dividend distribution.

## **Key Features**

1. **ETH/WETH Wrapping**  
   - Seamlessly wrap ETH into WETH and unwrap WETH back into ETH within the vault.  

2. **Portfolio Rebalancing**  
   - Automatically rebalance the portfolio between ETH/WETH and DAI based on predefined target allocations.  

3. **Real-Time Price Feeds**  
   - Fetch live ETH/USD prices from **Chainlink**.  
   - Retrieve ETH/DAI prices using **Uniswap V3** integration.  

4. **Dividend Distribution**  
   - Distribute dividends proportionally based on users' share of the vault's assets.  

5. **Access Control**  
   - Role-based access control ensures that only authorized users can perform critical operations.  

6. **Event Logging**  
   - Transparency through emitted events for actions like ETH wrapping, rebalancing, and dividend distribution.

## **Technical Details**

### **Smart Contract Components**

- **Core Contract**:  
  Manages vault assets and operations, including ETH wrapping, rebalancing, and dividend distribution.  

- **Chainlink Integration**:  
  Fetch ETH/USD prices using the `AggregatorV3Interface`.  

- **Uniswap V3 Integration**:  
  Use the `IQuoter` interface to fetch ETH/DAI prices for precise rebalancing.  

- **Access Control**:  
  Role-based permissions implemented with OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` or `AccessControl`.

### **Key Events**

```solidity
event EthPriceUpdated(uint256 newPrice);
event Rebalanced(uint256 daiBalance, uint256 wethBalance);
event DividendsDistributed(uint256 amount);
```

## **Workflow**

1. **Deposit ETH**:  
   - Users deposit ETH, which is automatically wrapped into WETH and added to the vault.  

2. **Portfolio Rebalancing**:  
   - The contract periodically rebalances the vault's assets between ETH/WETH and DAI.  

3. **Price Updates**:  
   - Real-time price data is fetched from Chainlink and Uniswap V3.  

4. **Dividend Distribution**:  
   - Dividends are distributed proportionally to users based on their vault shares.

## **Deployment Details**

- **Network**: Supports Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, and other EVM-compatible chains.  
- **Dependencies**:  
  - Chainlink ETH/USD price feed  
  - Uniswap V3 Quoter and Router  
  - WETH and DAI token contracts

## **Frontend Integration**

- **User Interface**:  
  Web app enabling users to:  
  - Deposit ETH  
  - View portfolio details  
  - Trigger rebalancing  

- **Blockchain Interaction**:  
  Use **ethers.js** or **web3.js** to connect with the smart contract.

## **Security Considerations**

- **Reentrancy Protection**:  
  - Incorporate `ReentrancyGuard` to mitigate reentrancy attacks.  

- **Input Validation**:  
  - Validate all inputs to prevent unexpected behavior.  

- **Access Control**:  
  - Restrict critical functions to authorized roles.  

- **Testing**:  
  - Comprehensive unit tests and third-party audits ensure security and reliability.

## **Future Enhancements**

1. **Support for More Assets**:  
   - Expand to include USDC, WBTC, and additional tokens.  

2. **Yield Farming**:  
   - Integrate with protocols like Aave or Compound to generate yield on vault assets.  

3. **Governance Mechanism**:  
   - Implement decentralized governance for user-driven decision-making.  

4. **Gas Optimization**:  
   - Minimize gas usage for cost efficiency.
